Group 4 investigation of Group 6
Date: 17 April 2018

The investigation of Group 6's Automated Vulnerability Detector was somewhat short due to the fact that the program's
focus was on evaluating the security of websites; hence, there being no data to protect. Therefore it was difficult for
us to find a good way to objectively evaluate your project. In your case your project has no security holes because
it is not about keeping information private but it is about finding the vulnerabilities. The other issue we had is that
it is hard to evaluate the project based on design decisions because none of these decisions compromise the program in
any way either.

Therefore it is our decision that our evaluation is going to be based on recommendations for expanding the project to
make it more versatile. One such idea to add to the program would be a way to evaluate existing security bugs. One of
the ideas we had for a more versatile application is to keep track of major security flaws found in various different
programs such as a check to make sure the PHP version is up to date or a node library is not installed. This way the
programs capabilities can be expanded as new application flaws are discovered and the program can warn the user.
This database can be used to keep up to date on flaws and with some basic parsing can be used to warn users as new
vulnerabilities are discovered.
